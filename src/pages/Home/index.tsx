          I decided to use this project to show you my work. I will try to add
          more information, examples and update regularly. This project has
          links to my projects in the github repositories, there are also
          projects that you can see here. These are mini projects to see how I
          can code. I have attached github links to these mini projects. I want
          to update this project regularly, and when I learn something new, I
          will add my new knowledge here and you can see it. This is the main
          goal of this project.
